# Bentley
Fetches and parses job postings from Gmail so you don't have to!

## Problem
Job board alerts are overwhelming in their number, frequency, and content. Each individual email is filled not only with new job postings but also with older postings that only serve to clutter the content. Combine this with the sheer number of emails sent to you and it's impossible for any one human to keep track of things.

## Solution
Bentley is a script designed to fetch those emails, parse them, and de-dupe job postings for you.
